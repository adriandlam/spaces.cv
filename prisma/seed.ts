      about: `I'm super passionate about building stuff that either solves real problems or helps me learn new concepts (super firm believer in project-based learning).

I also enjoy reflecting deeply about society, one's place in it, and where we're all heading. I think reflecting is a good way to improve oneself since it's important to have an outlook on life that isn't just about the present, but also considers the bigger picture.

When I'm not building or reflecting, I love venturing outdoors (preferably roadtrips in the mountains with no plans). After doing a bunch of these sidequests, I discovered that I really enjoy photography, it feels like a way to capture memories and share a glimpse of what I felt in the moment with others.`,
