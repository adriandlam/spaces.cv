      about: `I'm super passionate about building stuff that either solves real problems or helps me learn new concepts (super firm believer in project-based learning).

I also enjoy reflecting deeply about society, one's place in it, and where we're all heading. I think reflecting is a good way to improve oneself since it's important to have an outlook on life that isn't just about the present, but also considers the bigger picture.

When I'm not building or reflecting, I love venturing outdoors (preferably roadtrips in the mountains with no plans). After doing a bunch of these sidequests, I discovered that I really enjoy photography, it feels like a way to capture memories and share a glimpse of what I felt in the moment with others.`,

Currently doing research on real-time guarantees for edge computing.

Also :p other than this, I'm a huge cinephile and music nerd. I play guitar and the Blues - my favourite artist is John Mayer. I'm still unsure about my favourite director though (Wes Anderson seems pick me lol maybe Imtiaz Ali).`,
